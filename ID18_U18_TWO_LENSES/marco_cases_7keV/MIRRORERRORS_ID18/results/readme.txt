results of running wofry with slope errors from file

x0: no errors
x1: using the file with ~150nrad slope error
x0p5: using the file scaled (*0.35) to give half value of slope error
x2:  using the file scaled (*2) to give double value of slope error

2D plot are in a fake wavefrong saved as h5 file
